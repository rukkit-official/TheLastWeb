wanted a communication system that could survive nuclear attacks.
The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) developed a new type of
network called ARPANET.
</p>

<ul>
<li>1969: First connection between UCLA and Stanford</li>
<li>Packet switching technology developed</li>
<li>Used mainly for military and research communication</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. 1970s: The Birth of TCP/IP</h2>

<p>
During the 1970s, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn developed the TCP/IP protocol.
This became the foundation of modern Internet communication.
</p>

<ul>
<li>1974: TCP protocol proposed</li>
<li>1983: ARPANET officially adopted TCP/IP</li>
<li>Email becomes popular among researchers</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. 1980s: Expansion and Domain Names</h2>

<p>
The network expanded beyond military use into universities and research institutions.
The Domain Name System (DNS) was introduced to replace numeric IP addresses
with human-readable domain names.
</p>

<ul>
<li>1984: DNS created</li>
<li>.com, .org, .edu domains introduced</li>
<li>NSFNET expanded the network in the United States</li>
</ul>
